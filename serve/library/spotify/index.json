Various parameters are allowed to fine-tune recommendations. Any unchanged parameters will be ignored. Spotify gives definitions for the \"max\", \"min\", and \"target\" parameters.\n\nA minimum parameter:\n\nA hard ceiling on the selected track attribute\u0027s value can be provided. For example, maxInstrumentalness\u003d0.35 would filter out most tracks that are likely to be instrumental.\n\nA minimum parameter:\n\nA hard floor on the selected track attribute\u0027s value can be provided. For example, minTempo\u003d140 would restrict results to only those tracks with a tempo of greater than 140 beats per minute.\n\nA target parameter:\n\nTracks with the attribute values nearest to the target values will be preferred. For example, you might request targetEnergy\u003d0.6 and targetDanceability\u003d0.8. All target values will be weighed equally in ranking results."},{"id":"recommendations.ql-recommend-","type":"function","parent":"Recommender","title":"fun recommend()","file":"recommendations.ql","url":"/library/spotify/entity/Recommender.html#fun+recommend%28%29","library":"spotify","description":"Returns a list of songs that are recommended based on properties of the entity."},{"id":"recommendations.ql-recommend-trackLimitOverride","type":"function","parent":"Recommender","title":"native fun recommend(trackLimitOverride)","file":"recommendations.ql","url":"/library/spotify/entity/Recommender.html#native+fun+recommend%28trackLimitOverride%29","library":"spotify","description":"Returns a list of songs that are recommended based on properties of the entity."},{"id":"playlist_tools.ql-addToPlaylist-playlist,songList","type":"function","parent":null,"title":"native fun addToPlaylist(playlist, songList)","file":"playlist_tools.ql","url":"/library/spotify/#native+fun+addToPlaylist%28playlist%2C+songList%29","library":"spotify","description":"Adds the given song list to the given playlist."},{"id":"playlist_tools.ql-createPlaylist-name","type":"function","parent":null,"title":"native fun createPlaylist(name)","file":"playlist_tools.ql","url":"/library/spotify/#native+fun+createPlaylist%28name%29","library":"spotify","description":"Creates a new playlist with the given name."},{"id":"playlist_tools.ql-createPlaylist-name,desc","type":"function","parent":null,"title":"native fun createPlaylist(name, desc)","file":"playlist_tools.ql","url":"/library/spotify/#native+fun+createPlaylist%28name%2C+desc%29","library":"spotify","description":"Creates a new playlist with the given name and description."},{"id":"blocking_queue.ql-disableBlockingQueue-","type":"function","parent":null,"title":"native fun disableBlockingQueue()","file":"blocking_queue.ql","url":"/library/spotify/#native+fun+disableBlockingQueue%28%29","library":"spotify","description":"When songs are played, they are added to the queue immediately."},{"id":"blocking_queue.ql-enableBlockingQueue-","type":"function","parent":null,"title":"fun enableBlockingQueue()","file":"blocking_queue.ql","url":"/library/spotify/#fun+enableBlockingQueue%28%29","library":"spotify","description":"When songs are played, they are added to the queue when the currently playing song ends.
